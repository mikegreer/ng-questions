# Answer Me This

A high-fidelity prototype of the quote flow. This can be used for running live tests, better shared understanding with the development team, and to prototype potential data structures.<br>
Over time, this should grow into a highly reusable test suite to allow quote funnel prototypes to be created and tested quickly with live or near-live data.

## Getting set up

In the project directory, run

### `yarn`

to install dependencies.

Then run

### `yarn start`

to start the development server and interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
